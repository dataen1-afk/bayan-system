# Service Contract Management System - PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Build a full-stack application for managing service contracts for Bayan Auditing & Conformity with the following workflow:
1. Admin creates a form by entering client information (name, company, email, phone)
2. System generates a unique public link for the form
3. Admin shares the link with the client (via email, WhatsApp, etc.)
4. Client fills out the form via the public link (NO LOGIN REQUIRED)
5. Client submits the form - system auto-calculates audit duration
6. Admin reviews the submission and creates a price quote/proposal
7. Client can approve or reject the proposal
8. **If approved**: Client fills the Certification Agreement form
9. Agreement submission finalizes the contract & PDF is generated

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Motor (async MongoDB driver), Pydantic, JWT, ReportLab (PDF), openpyxl (Excel)
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, react-router-dom, axios
- **Internationalization**: i18next, react-i18next
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Complete Workflow
```
Admin creates form → Client fills form (public link) → Form submitted → 
Audit calculation runs → Admin creates proposal → Proposal sent to client →
Client accepts proposal → Client fills Agreement form → Contract PDF generated
```

## UI Components Update (December 2025)

### DataTable Component ✅ (NEW/FIXED)
- **Location**: `/app/frontend/src/components/DataTable.js`
- **Purpose**: Professional reusable table component with:
  - Pagination, search, sorting, filtering
  - **Native RTL Support**: Uses `dir="rtl"` attribute instead of `flex-row-reverse` classes
  - Works across Forms, Quotations, and Contracts tabs
- **Key RTL Implementation**:
  - Table body uses `dir={isRTL ? 'rtl' : 'ltr'}` for native browser RTL support
  - Row cells use `text-start` class which auto-adjusts based on dir attribute
  - Action columns have `dir="ltr"` to maintain consistent button order

### RTL Layout Fix (December 2025) ✅
- **Issue**: Previous implementation used CSS `flex-row-reverse` conditionally, which was unreliable
- **Solution**: Changed to native HTML `dir` attribute approach:
  1. Table body wrapper has `dir="rtl"` for Arabic
  2. This makes flexbox naturally reverse
  3. Action column uses `dir="ltr"` to keep button order consistent
- **Result**: In Arabic mode:
  - Action buttons appear on **LEFT**
  - Data columns (company name) appear on **RIGHT**
  - Works correctly across Forms, Quotations, Contracts tabs

### Data Table Professional Layout Fix (February 2026) ✅
- **Issue**: Data overlapping in Forms, Quotations, and Contracts tabs. Action icons not visible properly.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Changed from fixed percentage widths to min-width + flex-1 approach
  2. Added horizontal scrolling for smaller screens
  3. Used square icon buttons (w-8 h-8 p-0) for consistent action column layout
  4. Added proper gap spacing (gap-1.5) between action buttons
  5. Added tooltips (title attribute) for truncated text
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.js` - Updated column definitions and row rendering
  - `/app/frontend/src/components/DataTable.js` - Added overflow-x-auto and min-width to table
- **Result**:
  - All data visible without overlap
  - Action icons clearly displayed with consistent spacing
  - Professional layout across all three tabs (Forms, Quotations, Contracts)
  - Hover tooltips show full text for truncated fields

## Bug Fixes (February 2026)
### P0: Proposal Creation with Signature/Stamp Images ✅ (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Creating a price quote with signature and stamp images showed `[object Object]` error
- **Root Cause**: Frontend error handling didn't properly parse Pydantic validation error arrays
- **Fix**: Updated `CreateProposalPage.js` lines 167-216 to handle Array.isArray(detail) case
- **Result**: Proposals with ~400KB payloads (including base64 signature/stamp) now work correctly
- **Test File**: `/app/backend/tests/test_proposal_creation.py`
